# Daily Wallpapers
A Node.js script that can be run daily to download new wallpapers from Unsplash.com if available.

## Setting it up
Copy or rename `config-example.yml` to `config.yml` in the root folder, set your Unsplash.com app key & secret and change your preferred settings.

Now you're good to go! Every time you run this it will download new wallpapers from Unsplash.com if new ones are available. I suggest running it once a day since the wallpaper collection is not updated that often, and to not unnecessarily stress the Unsplash.com API.
